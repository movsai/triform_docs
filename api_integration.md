# API Integration in Triform

Triform offers powerful API features that allow you to integrate your Modules and Flows with external applications. This section will guide you through the process of using and managing the Triform API.

## Understanding Triform API

The Triform API provides programmable access to your Modules and Flows, enabling you to trigger actions and retrieve data programmatically.

## Integrating with External Applications

Integrating Triform's API with your applications can automate tasks and enhance functionality.

### Steps for API Integration:

1. **Accessing API Information**:
   - In the Triform dashboard, navigate to the 'Flows' section.
   - Select a Flow and view its 'API Information'.
   - Here, you'll find the endpoint URL and instructions for API requests.

2. **Using the API Endpoint**:
   - Utilize the provided endpoint URL in your external application to make requests to your Flow.
   - Include any necessary authentication tokens or headers as required by your Flow.

## Managing API Usage

Keeping track of your API usage is essential to ensure your applications run smoothly without hitting rate limits.

### Monitoring API Usage:

- Regularly check the API usage statistics provided in the Triform dashboard.
- Plan your application's API calls to stay within the usage limits of your subscription plan.

## Handling API Rate Limits

Triform imposes rate limits to ensure fair usage and optimal performance for all users.

### What to Do When Nearing Rate Limits:

- If you're approaching your API rate limit, consider optimizing your API calls or upgrading your subscription plan for higher limits.
- In case of hitting the rate limit, your API requests will be temporarily blocked until the limit resets.

## Best Practices for API Integration

- Use API calls judiciously to avoid unnecessary load and stay within rate limits.
- Secure your API keys and tokens; do not expose them in client-side code.
- Regularly update and test your API integrations to adapt to any changes in the Triform API.

In this section, we covered how to integrate and manage the Triform API. Effective use of the API can significantly enhance the automation and functionality of your applications.
